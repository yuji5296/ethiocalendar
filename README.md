In Ethiopia, they use the original calendar which is much different from the Gregorian calendar. Therefore I developed calendar software which it can see both the Gregorian calendar and the Ethiopian calendar in one glance.

This application was developed by JOCV(Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers) dispatched by JICA(Japan Internatonal Cooperation Agency) as volunteer activity. So JICA's logo was used unofficially as an acknowledgment of my gratitude. However, it will be deleted in the next version due to JICA's instruction.
