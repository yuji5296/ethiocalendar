**This application was developed by [JOCV(Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers)](http://www.jica.go.jp/english/operations/schemes/citizen/volunteers.html) dispatched by [JICA(Japan Internatonal Cooperation Agency)](http://www.jica.go.jp/english/) as volunteer activity. So JICA's logo was used unofficially as an acknowledgment of my gratitude. However, it will be deleted in the next version due to JICA's instruction.**
